<h1>About this Application</h1>
<p>This project is a re-development of a C#-based team project from the Epicodus C# class called *eHappenings*. The C# code has been converted to javascript and Angular
and the C# Model/View/Controller structure has been converted to the Angular Model/View/Component structure.
Much of the styling has been kept from the C# project and credit for the styling goes to Clara Munro and Micaela Jawor.</p>
